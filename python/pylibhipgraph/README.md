The `pylibhipgraph` Python module exposes most of hipGRAPH's C API,
covering the
[rocGRAPH](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocGRAPH) and
[cuGRAPH](https://developer.nvidia.com/cugraph) backends.

hipGRAPH is a GRAPH wrapper library with multiple supported
backends. It is a wrapper between your application and a
'worker' GRAPH library. hipGRAPH exports an interface that
doesn't require the client to change, regardless of the chosen
backend. Currently, hipGRAPH supports
[rocGRAPH](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/rocGRAPH)
and [cuGRAPH](https://developer.nvidia.com/cugraph) backends.

## Documentation

Documentation for pylibhipgraph is in progress and will be generated by
the source code's docstrings.

## Building pylibhipgraph

This module follows [typical Python packaging
conventions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/) and requires
hipGRAPH to be installed.

[build module](https://build.pypa.io/en/stable/)

   ```bash
   python3 -m build
   ```

This will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, create a
sdist (source distribution), and then build the module from the sdist.

Current internal dependencies:
- `cython` >= 3.0.0
- `scikit-build-core[pyproject]` >= 0.7.0
- `setuptools` >=40.8.0

The build system in general requires `cmake`, `python3`, `pip`, and
other common tools. The system also runs under `conda` but does not yet
produce `conda`-specific packages.

If hipGRAPH and the ROCm stack are installed into a non-default
location, for example `/usr/local/rocm` rather than `/opt/rocm`,
set the `CMAKE_ARGS` environment variable appropriately.
`CMakeLists.txt` searches for the config-style CMake settings in
`lib/cmake` under that directory.

   ```bash
   env CMAKE_ARGS='-DROCM_DIRECTORY:PATH=/usr/local/rocm' python3 -m build
   ```

If you intent on redistributing the wheel, you will want to run it
through a tool like [auditwheel](https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel), or
build it within an appropriate `manylinux` container.
